## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
App: Messages
- Changing the background through a text message
- Editing text messages after being sent

App: Photos
- Requiring face ID to view deleted/hidden photos
- Creating shared albums

App: Instagram
- Adding music to a post or story
- Creating drafts 

An app I would like to improve is the Notes app. Notes allows you to create notes and seperates them by date. Some features notes has is font size, gride table, checked/dashed/bulleted points, file attchment, and more. Some features I would like to implement is changing font color that way its easier to differenciate text within a note. Another improvment I would like to add is being able to adjust size of the boxes within a gride table. Lastly, I would add a feature that could change the background color of the note, maybe even an image.  


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Some challenges I faced was trying to connect UI to logic, At first I couldnt find  the adjust editor options, but onced I figured it out I was confused on control draging the button onto the ViewController. I wasnt sure if I was doing it right until I saw my IBAction in code. Other then that, the instructions were helpful and clear.
